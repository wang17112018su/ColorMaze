Rules for game
```
1. The game starts with the user being presented with a white button and a red button.

2. If the user clicks the white button, the user will need to choose between another white button and an orange one.

3. If the user clicks the red button, he will be presented with a black button and another red button.

4. When the second red button is clicked, the user loses and will have to restart the game from Rule 1.

5. Referring back to Rule 2, if the user clicks the second white button, he will have to choose between a black button or red one now 

6. When the red button (from Rule 5) is clicked, the user loses and will restart the game from Rule 1.

7. On the other hand, if the user clicked an orange button, he can choose between 3 buttons - green, orange and black.

8. When the user is at the point where he can choose between green, orange and black, and he picks either green or orange, he will have to choose the other colour subsequently from a pair of green and orange to win the game, otherwise, he loses and restart the game from Rule 1.

9. If the user ever picks a black button, he will be at the point where he has to choose between green, orange and black.
